### Purpose:
My weather app was developed for Mobile app Scripting as A task,this task would purely be design and styling without any backend or dynamc data.The data used would be 'dummy data'.
The Purpose of this Task was to Design a Weather app which displays the City, Date and time ,Temperature and the condition..

-The ScreenShot above shows the temperature in Fahrenheit.

### Reflection:

-The design used for this app is simple and sorely focuses on showing the weather and condition.
-The mood used for the app would depend on what the weather is like, similarly to the screenshots, if it was a rainy the background of the app would be rainy and dark but if it was sunny it was be light with sunny day.
